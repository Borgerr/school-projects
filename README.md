# School Projects

## NOTE: Some projects are not publicly included here

For purposes of academic conduct, not every cool project is included here.
If you're curious about other things I did in college, like memory allocators,
web servers in C, HTTP proxies in python, various kernels,
*please* do not be afraid to send me a message.
You can find my contact information on [my webpage](<https://borgerr.github.io>).
