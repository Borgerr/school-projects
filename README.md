# School Projects

Each subdirectory of the root directory contains some backup of a noteworthy class repository. Currently, we have:

- An image editor from Utah Tech University's CS3005 course, "Software Development in C++"
- A spreadsheet from University of Utah's CS3500 course, "Software Development"
- A fully functional online multiplayer version of Snake, from University of Utah's CS3500 course, "Software Development"
